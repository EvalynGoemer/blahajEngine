# blahajEngine
A work in progress game engine made using C++ and Vulkan.

⚠️ The engine currently supports Linux only (works on Steam Deck with debug mode off). Windows builds for specific versions may be made upon request, but Windows is NOT a priority. ⚠️

## Build Instructions
You will need the following packages for building on Arch Linux
- base-devel
- vulkan-devel
- glfw
- glm
- stb
- lua

With the correct packages installed you can just run `make` with the included Makefile to compile the program and the shaders
